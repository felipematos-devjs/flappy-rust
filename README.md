# Flappy Rust

A little flappy bird clone, made in the Rust programming language for learning purposes.

It uses the Bevy engine's ECS, and the Macroquad crate to draw sprites, it was a lot of fun to make!

In the future, I want to make my very own graphics renderer using webGPU.

##Todos:
- Organize and clean code up by splitting files into submodules
- Organize assets folder
- Create a single HashMap for assets instead of multiple resources
- Generate some simple documentation
- Embed files into executable for release
