# Flappy Rust

A little flappy bird clone, made in the Rust programming language for learning purposes.

It uses the Bevy engine's ECS, and the Macroquad crate to draw sprites, it was a lot of fun to make!

In the future, I want to make my very own graphics renderer using webGPU.

## How to Play?
Just click on "Releases", download the .rar file, extract it, and run the executable.
