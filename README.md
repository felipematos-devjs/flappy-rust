# Flappy Rust

A little flappy bird clone, made in the Rust programming language for learning purposes.

It uses the Bevy engine's ECS, and the Macroquad crate to draw sprites, it was a lot of fun to make!

In the future, I want to make my very own graphics renderer using webGPU.

## Instructions
- Install Rust. It depends on your OS
- run the project with ```cargo run```
- Enjoy!
